MediaEval2012-PlacingTask-IRISA
===============================

The task requires participants to automatically assign latitude and longitude coordinates to each of the provided test videos. This kind of geographical location tag, or geotag, helps users localise videos, allowing their media to be anchored to real world locations. Currently, however, most videos online are not labelled with this kind of data. This task encourages participants to find innovative ways of doing this labelling automatically. The data comes from Flickr, an example of a photo sharing website that allows users to both encode their photos and videos with geotags, as well as use them when searching and browsing. This paper describes the task, the data sets provided and how the individual participants results are evaluated.
